Given an increasing sorted rotated array arr of distinct integers. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.
Let's suppose we have an array arr = [2, 4, 6, 9], so if we rotate it by 2 times so that it will look like this:
After 1st Rotation : [9, 2, 4, 6]
After 2nd Rotation : [6, 9, 2, 4]


SOLUTION:

class Solution:
    def findKRotation(self, arr):
        n=len(arr)
        low=0
        high=n-1
        ans=float('inf')
        if arr[low]<=arr[high]:
            return 0
        while low<=high:
            mid=low+(high-low)//2
            if arr[mid]<=arr[high]:
                high=high-1
            elif arr[mid]>=arr[low]:
                low=mid+1

        return low
