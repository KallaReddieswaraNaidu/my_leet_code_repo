Sorted Array Search
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 48.03%Submissions: 322K+Points: 1
Given an array, arr[] sorted in ascending order and an integer k. Return true if k is present in the array, otherwise, false.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], k = 6
Output: true
Exlpanation: Since, 6 is present in the array at index 4 (0-based indexing), output is true.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], k = 3
Output: false
Exlpanation: Since, 3 is not present in the array, output is false.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 5, 6], k = 1
Output: false
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
1 <= k <= 106
1 <= arr[i] <= 106

SOLUTION:
class Solution:
    ##Complete this function
    def searchInSorted(self,arr, k):
        n=len(arr)
        i=0
        while i<n:
            if(k==arr[i]):
                return True
            else:
                i=i+1
        return False
