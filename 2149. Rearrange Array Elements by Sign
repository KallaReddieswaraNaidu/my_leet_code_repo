Intuition
append based on positive and negatie at odd and even indexes

Approach
take an empty array of size n and initialise with zeros and run a loop from i to n-1 and if number is positive append at even indexs and if number is negative append at odd indexs

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(N)

Space complexity:
O(N)

Code
class Solution(object):
    def rearrangeArray(self, nums):
        i=0
        pos=0
        neg=0
        n=len(nums)
        rnums = [0] * n
        
        pj=0
        nj=1
        while i<n:
            if(nums[i]>=0 and pj<n):
                pos=nums[i]
                rnums[pj]=pos
                pj=pj+2
            if(nums[i]<0 and nj<n):
                neg=nums[i]
                rnums[nj]=neg
                nj=nj+2
            i=i+1
        return rnums
